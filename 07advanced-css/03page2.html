        <h1>Step by Step Guide</h1>
        
        <h2>Step 1</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Conditioning the Clay: Take your block of clay and knead it between your hands to soften it. If the clay is too hard, you can warm it slightly by rolling it or use a clay softener.</li>
            <li>Shaping and Tools: Shape the clay into your desired form using your hands or tools.</li>
            <li>Smoothing the Surface: To remove fingerprints or imperfections, use a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a soft brush or a smoothing tool to gently polish the surface. This ensures a professional finish before baking.</li>
            
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Step 2</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to the recommended temperature on your clay packaging (usually between 265°F and 275°F).</li>
            <li>Prepare the Baking Surface: Place your clay piece on a ceramic tile, parchment paper, or a dedicated baking tray to prevent the clay from sticking or burning.</li>
            <li>Bake Time: The baking time depends on the thickness of your project. A general rule is to bake for 15-30 minutes per 1/4 inch (6mm) of thickness. <a href="https://www.sculpey.com/products/baking-polymer-clay#:~:text=In%20most%20cases%2C%20you%20can,brittle%20pieces%20that%20break%20easily." target="_blank"> More baking information.</a></li>
